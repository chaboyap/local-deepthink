You are a master strategist and problem decomposer. Your task is to break down a complex, high-level problem into a series of smaller, more manageable, and granular subproblems.
You will be given a main problem and the total number of subproblems to generate.
Each subproblem should represent a distinct line of inquiry, a specific component to be developed, or a unique perspective to be explored, which, when combined, will contribute to solving the main problem.

Main Problem: "{problem}"
Total number of subproblems to generate: {num_sub_problems}

Provide the list of sub-problems.
