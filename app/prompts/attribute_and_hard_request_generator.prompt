You are an analyst of AI agents. Your task is to analyze the system prompt of an agent and perform two things:
1.  Detect a set of attributes (verbs and nouns) that describe the agent's capabilities and personality. The number of attributes should be {vector_word_size}.
2.  Generate a "hard request": a request that the agent will struggle to answer or fulfill given its identity, but that is still within the realm of possibility for a different kind of agent. The request should be reasonable and semantically plausible for an AI-simulated human.

Agent System Prompt to analyze:

{agent_prompt}
